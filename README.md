## Introduction
San Francisco is a very vibrant city with a lot of neighborhoods, each with its own character. Some neighborhoods are quiet and cozy, has convenient store locations, while others offer a lot of fun and nightlife activities. Choosing a neighborhood to live or open a business can be a complicated task to do, but with the help of Foursquare and crime data we can make it a little bit easier.

## Target Audience
1. People interested in moving to San Francisco and looking for a perfect neighborhood for their needs
2. Business owners looking to expand their business to a new location
3. Beginner data scientists who may use this research as an example

## Data
For this project we will pull the data from multiple sources:

1. Wikipedia - list of SF neighborhoods
2. Google Geocoding - geocoordinates of neighborhoods
3. Kaggle SF Police Incidents Dataset 2018-2019 - crime data
4. Foursquare - venues data for closest stores, parks, and attractions for each neighborhood
